# Customer banking


Description

Overall point of the project is to create a customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on savings and CD accounts. By running this application, users will be able to enter their savings and CD account information, see the interest earned, and view the updated balances after a specified number of months.

Features:
* Calculate interest earned on savinngs and CD accounts
* Track interests earned over time
* Update account balances to reflect interest earned

The customer banking system will be promted to enter the following information:
* Account type (saving and CD)
* Account balance
* Interest rate
* Number of months
The application will then calculate the interest earned and update the account balance. The results will be displayed on the screen. 

Summary: 
Overall this program accoumplished the task of taking information from the customer and outputing the calculated and updated balaces on Saving and CD accounts.

Challenges
The biggest challenge for me was to link cd_account and saving_account files to the one customer_banking file and get the output.
